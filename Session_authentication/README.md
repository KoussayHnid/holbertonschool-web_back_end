--------------------Session authentication--------------
Session authentication is a method used in backend systems to manage user authentication and maintain user sessions during interactions with a web application. 

Here’s how it works:

User Login: When a user logs in with their credentials (username and password), the backend verifies these credentials.

Session Creation: Upon successful authentication, the server creates a session for the user. This session is typically stored on the server side and is associated with a unique session ID.

Session ID: The server generates a session ID (often a long, random string) and sends it back to the client, usually as a cookie. This session ID allows the server to identify the user in subsequent requests.

Session Storage: The session ID is used to retrieve session data (like user information and permissions) stored on the server. This allows the application to remember the user's state across multiple requests.

Maintaining State: For each subsequent request from the user, the client sends the session ID back to the server (via cookies or other means). The server uses this ID to retrieve the session data and authenticate the user without requiring them to log in again.

Session Expiration: Sessions typically have a limited lifespan for security reasons. After a certain period of inactivity or after a predefined duration, the session can expire, requiring the user to log in again.

Logout: When the user logs out, the server invalidates the session, which removes access to the session data associated with that session ID.

*Advantages of Session Authentication:
Security: 
Since session data is stored on the server, it’s less vulnerable to client-side attacks compared to other methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) where data is stored on the client.
Easier State Management: Server-side sessions can easily handle complex user states, such as permissions and preferences.
Disadvantages:
Scalability: 
Session authentication can be more challenging to scale, as it requires session storage management across multiple servers.
Resource Consumption: Storing sessions on the server consumes resources, which may be a consideration for applications with many concurrent users.
Session authentication is commonly used in web applications where security and user experience are essential, allowing seamless navigation without repeatedly asking users to log in.
