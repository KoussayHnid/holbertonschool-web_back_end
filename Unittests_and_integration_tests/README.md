-------------------Unit Tests and Integration Tests------------------
*Description:
This project focuses on the implementation of unit and integration tests for Python programs. It provides a hands-on experience with various testing concepts such as mocking, parameterization, and fixtures, ensuring that both individual functions and the interactions between various components in a program are tested effectively:
*Learning Objectives:

1. Understand the difference between unit and integration tests.
2. Mock external calls like HTTP requests or database interactions during tests.
3. Apply common testing patterns such as mocking, parameterization, and fixtures.
4. Write clear and concise unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for end-to-end code execution.
